## About

**fastify-bookmarkly** is an example backend API using the [Fastify][fastify] framework, MongoDB, and a [clean architecture][clean].

Parts of the original code are from Bill Sourour's [DevMastery Comments Microservice API][clean-micro] and [Clean RESTful API with Node.js][clean-node].

The project is a learning repository where I explore how to code a "clean" Node API from scratch.
