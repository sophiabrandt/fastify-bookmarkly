## About

**fastify-bookmarkly** is an example backend API using the [Fastify][fastify] framework, MongoDB, and a [clean architecture][clean].

Parts of the original code are from Bill Sourour's [DevMastery Comments Microservice API][clean-micro] and [Clean RESTful API with Node.js][clean-node].

The project is a learning repository where I explore how to code a "clean" Node API from scratch.

### Built With

- Node.js & [Fastify][fastify]
- Docker & Docker Compose
- MongoDB

## Installation

#### Prerequisites:

- Node.js
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

#### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:sophiabrandt/fastify-bookmarkly.git && cd fastify-bookmarkly
```

#### 2. Adjust configuration

Check the `config` folder and change the name of variables as needed.

#### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
$ pnpm install # or npm install
```

#### 4. Use Docker and Docker Compose to spin up the Mongo Database

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

#### 5. Create Database schema

```bash
$ pnpm run db # or npm run db
```

## Usage

```bash
$ pnpm run dev # or npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000/bookmarks` with your browser.

To create a production build:

```bash
$ pnpm run build # or npm run build
$ pnpm run start # or npm run start
```

## Tests

```bash
$ pnpm run test # or npm run test
```

For now, the tests contain stubs, but are are already connected to MongoDB.
